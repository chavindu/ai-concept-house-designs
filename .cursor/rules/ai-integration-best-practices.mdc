- Implement error handling for API calls to the AI service to manage failures gracefully.
- Cache AI responses where applicable to reduce redundant calls and improve performance.
- Use asynchronous processing for AI tasks to avoid blocking the main thread.
- Ensure data privacy and compliance when handling user inputs for AI generation.
- Monitor AI service usage and performance to optimize costs and efficiency.
