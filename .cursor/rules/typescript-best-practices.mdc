- Enable strict mode for better type safety and error detection.
- Prefer using interfaces over type aliases for object shapes.
- Utilize generics to create reusable components and functions.
- Implement type guards to ensure type safety in conditional logic.
- Use enums for fixed sets of values to improve code readability.
