  "minimalist-tropical": {
    styleName: "Minimalist Tropical Villa",
    inspiration:
      "A fusion of minimalist architectural principles with tropical climate adaptation. The design should emphasize clean lines, volumetric purity, and a profound, seamless connection to the surrounding landscape, drawing inspiration from contemporary Southeast Asian and South American minimalist architecture.",
    keyElements: "different volumetric compositions and material expressions",
    keyFeatures:
      "The boundary between inside and out should be blurred. This is mandatory and achieved through features like floor-to-ceiling sliding glass walls, internal courtyards, and covered terraces that function as outdoor rooms.",
    designLanguage:
      "Architectural Style: Tropical Minimalism / Contemporary Tropical.\n\nForm: Strong rectilinear and cubic geometry. The design should feature interlocking and stacked volumes, dramatic cantilevers, and double-height spaces.\n\nVentilation & Light: Natural light and airflow are controlled through architectural elements. This includes timber or concrete brise-soleil (sun-breakers), perforated brickwork (jaali screens), and vertical louvers that create dynamic patterns of light and shadow.",
    materials:
      "Walls/Structure: smooth white or grey plastered finishes, exposed brick (natural red or dark tones), and Fair-faced or raw board-form concrete\n\nFacades & Screens: Natural wood, often used as vertical cladding, louvers or screens. Perforated metal panels (corten steel or powder-coated aluminum) are also a key option.\n\nGlazing: Expansive floor-to-ceiling glass panels and sliding doors with minimal black or dark charcoal frames or wooden frames.",
    creativeDirection:
      "Each generated design must present a fresh concept by creatively reinterpreting the following:\n• Volumetric Play: Explore different arrangements of stacked, interlocking, and cantilevered cubic forms to create a unique building silhouette.\n• Facade Materiality: Vary the dominant material on the main facade. One version could be heavily concrete-focused, another wrapped in a timber screen, and a third featuring an intricate perforated brick pattern.\n• Solid vs. Void: Experiment with the balance between solid, heavy masses (concrete walls) and light, transparent voids (glass walls, open terraces, double-height spaces).\n• Integration of Greenery: Innovate the way planting is integrated directly into the architecture, such as through internal courtyards open to the sky, green walls, or rooftop gardens.",

  "bawa-tropical": {
    styleName: "Bawa-Style Tropical Modern Villa",
    inspiration:
      "A fusion of Geoffrey Bawa's tropical modernist principles with contemporary design sensibilities. The villa should emphasize indoor-outdoor continuity, framed views of nature, and spatial layering through courtyards, verandas, and shaded walkways. The design draws inspiration from Bawa's Sri Lankan tropical modernism, integrating climate responsiveness, material honesty, and poetic connections to the landscape.",
    keyElements: "courtyards, verandas, roofscapes, and material expressions",
    keyFeatures:
      "The boundary between inside and out should be blurred. This is mandatory and achieved through features like courtyards, shaded verandas, open terraces, and water elements that frame views of the garden. Transitional semi-open spaces should serve as gathering zones and circulation corridors.",
    designLanguage:
      "Architectural Style: Bawa-inspired Tropical Modernism / Contemporary Tropical.\n\nForm: Pavilion-like arrangements with courtyards, shaded verandas, interlocking volumes, and a balance of solids and voids. Subtle use of axial views, framed openings, and layered spatial progression.\n\nVentilation & Light: Emphasis on natural ventilation, cross-breezes, and soft daylight. Achieved through courtyards, timber latticework, perforated brick (jaali), and clerestory openings that create dramatic shadow play.",
    materials:
      "Walls/Structure: White plastered walls, exposed brick, rough plaster finishes, and fair-faced concrete in select areas.\n\nFacades & Screens: Timber lattice, vertical timber screens, woven panels, or perforated brickwork.\n\nGlazing: Timber-framed windows and sliding doors, occasionally with black/charcoal steel detailing. Openings should emphasize horizontality and frame nature.",
    creativeDirection:
      "Each generated design must present a fresh interpretation by creatively reinterpreting the following:\n• Courtyard Play: Explore different placements of courtyards as organizing elements of the villa.\n• Facade Materiality: Vary between brick-dominant, white-plastered, or timber-screened façades.\n• Solid vs. Void: Balance between shaded heavy walls and light open verandas.\n• Integration of Greenery: Innovate integration of gardens, ponds, and water bodies into circulation and living spaces.\n• Roof Variations: Explore tiled pitched roofs, flat roofs with pergolas, or hybrid compositions.",

  scandinavian: {
    styleName: "Contemporary Scandinavian-Style Villa",
    inspiration:

The villa should emphasize light-filled interiors, pitched roof forms, natural wood cladding, and large windows that connect to nature. The design draws inspiration from modern Scandinavian houses with simple geometry, muted color palettes, and cozy, functional living environments.",
    keyElements: "pitched roof compositions, timber and metal cladding, expansive glazing, and light-filled interiors",
    keyFeatures:
      "The boundary between inside and out should be softened. Achieved through expansive glazing, sliding doors, timber decks, terraces, and skylights that bring in daylight and connect the villa to its natural surroundings. Interiors should be uncluttered, functional, and warm, embracing Scandinavian 'hygge' comfort.",
    designLanguage:
      "Architectural Style: Contemporary Scandinavian / Nordic Modernism.\n\nForm: Clean rectilinear and pitched-roof volumes. Strong emphasis on symmetry, simplicity, and natural proportions.
